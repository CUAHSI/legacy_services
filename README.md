This is legacy code from the CUAHSI HIS project

There are two Visual Studio projects presently of interest. They were running on river.sdsc.edu until it's demise in early 2016.
* EPA:  legacy_webservices\BaseWofService\EPAWebService

* NWIS: legacy_webservices\BaseWofService\NwisDailyValuesWebService
** Noted that the Groundwater Service is the one of interest, at present, but all services packaged in the same webapp.
** since CUAHSI handles the catalog, it might be best to just extract code used by the GW values service.
